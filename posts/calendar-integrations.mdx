In today's connected workplace, no tool is an island. The most productive teams integrate their scheduling software with the rest of their tech stack. Here's how to get the most out of Schedule Builder's integrations.

## Available Integrations

Schedule Builder connects with dozens of popular apps across several categories:

### Communication
- **Slack:** Get notifications, create events from messages, check availability without leaving the chat
- **Microsoft Teams:** Similar functionality for Microsoft-centric organizations
- **Discord:** Perfect for communities and gaming organizations

### Productivity
- **Notion:** Sync tasks and embed schedules in your workspace
- **Todoist:** Two-way sync between tasks and calendar events
- **Trello:** Create calendar events from cards and vice versa

### Video Conferencing
- **Zoom:** Auto-generate meeting links when creating events
- **Google Meet:** Native integration for Google Workspace users
- **Microsoft Teams Meetings:** One-click meeting creation

## Setting Up Your First Integration

Getting started is straightforward:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations**
2. Find the app you want to connect
3. Click "Connect" and follow the authorization flow
4. Configure sync preferences

## Best Practices

### Don't Over-Integrate

More connections aren't always better. Each integration adds complexity and potential points of failure. Start with your most critical workflows and expand from there.

### Set Up Notification Rules

Avoid notification overload by configuring which events trigger alerts in which apps. Schedule Builder lets you set rules based on event type, calendar, and time.

### Regular Audits

Every quarter, review your integrations. Disconnect any you're not actively using—they may be consuming API limits or creating confusion.

## Coming Soon

We're constantly expanding our integration library. Coming in the next quarter:
- Asana integration
- Linear integration  
- Custom webhook support

Stay tuned to our changelog for updates!

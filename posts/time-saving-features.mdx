## 1. Recurring Events

Stop creating the same events manually every week. Set up recurring patterns once, and let the system handle the rest.

## 2. Drag-and-Drop Rescheduling

Need to move a meeting? Simply drag it to a new time slot instead of deleting and recreating it.

## 4. Bulk Editing

Select multiple events and edit them all at once—change times, add attendees, or update descriptions in bulk.

Learn the keyboard shortcuts for your scheduling tool. Creating events, navigating dates, and switching views becomes lightning-fast.

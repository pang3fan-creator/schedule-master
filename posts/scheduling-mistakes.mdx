Even experienced managers make scheduling mistakes that cost time, money, and team morale. Here are the five most common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

## 1. Overscheduling

**The Mistake:** Packing every minute with tasks or meetings, leaving no buffer time.

**The Solution:** Build in 15-30 minute buffers between major activities. This accounts for overruns and gives people time to transition mentally.

## 2. Ignoring Individual Preferences

**The Mistake:** Treating all team members identically without considering their peak productivity hours or personal commitments.

**The Solution:** When possible, survey your team about their preferred working hours and try to schedule demanding tasks accordingly.

## 3. Last-Minute Changes

**The Mistake:** Constantly changing schedules without adequate notice, creating confusion and frustration.

**The Solution:** Establish a change freeze period (e.g., 48 hours before) and communicate changes through a single, reliable channel.

## 4. Poor Documentation

**The Mistake:** Keeping schedules in your head or on scattered sticky notes, leading to miscommunication.

**The Solution:** Use a centralized scheduling tool that everyone can access. Document the reasoning behind scheduling decisions for future reference.

## 5. Not Planning for Absences

**The Mistake:** Creating schedules that fall apart when one person is sick or on vacation.

**The Solution:** Cross-train team members and build redundancy into critical roles. Maintain a backup coverage plan.

## Moving Forward

Recognizing these mistakes is the first step to better scheduling. Implement these solutions gradually, and you'll see improvements in team productivity and satisfaction.

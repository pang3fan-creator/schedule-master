Acme Corporation, a mid-sized tech company with 200 employees, was drowning in meetings. The average employee spent 23 hours per week in meetings—leaving precious little time for actual work. Here's how they turned things around.

## The Challenge

Like many growing companies, Acme had developed a meeting-heavy culture. Decision-making required sync-ups, sync-ups required status updates, and status updates became weekly rituals that no one questioned.

**The symptoms were clear:**
- Calendar fragmentation (few blocks longer than 30 minutes)
- Meeting fatigue and declining engagement
- Critical work happening after hours
- Top talent citing "too many meetings" in exit interviews

## The Solution

Acme partnered with us to implement a comprehensive scheduling overhaul. The approach combined tool adoption with cultural change.

### Phase 1: Audit

We helped Acme audit their existing meetings. The findings were eye-opening:
- 60% of recurring meetings had no clear agenda
- 40% of attendees in any given meeting were optional
- Average meeting ran 15 minutes over scheduled time

### Phase 2: Policy Implementation

Based on the audit, Acme implemented new policies:
- "No Meeting Wednesdays" for deep work
- Maximum 25-minute meetings (with hard stops)
- Required agendas for any meeting with 3+ attendees

### Phase 3: Tool Adoption

Schedule Builder became the central hub for all scheduling decisions. Key capabilities deployed:
- Automatic conflict detection
- Meeting cost calculator (showing aggregate salary time)
- Smart suggestions for optimal meeting times

## The Results

After three months, the transformation was measurable:

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Weekly meeting hours | 23 hrs | 14 hrs | -40% |
| Focus time blocks (2+ hrs) | 2/week | 6/week | +200% |
| Meeting satisfaction score | 5.2/10 | 7.8/10 | +50% |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Tools aren't enough:** Cultural buy-in from leadership was essential
2. **Start with quick wins:** No Meeting Wednesdays showed immediate impact
3. **Measure and share:** Sharing metrics weekly kept the momentum

Acme Corporation, a fast-growing tech company with 200 employees, was facing a silent productivity killer: **meeting overload**.

The data was staggering: the average employee spent **23 hours per week** in meetings, leaving less than 50% of their time for high-impact work. Here is how they leveraged smart scheduling strategies to reclaim their calendar and transform their culture.

## The Challenge: A Culture of "Sync-ups"

As Acme scaled, "calendar fragmentation" became the norm. Employees struggled with "Swiss cheese" schedules—small 15-to-30-minute gaps between meetings that made deep work impossible.

**The symptoms were undeniable:**
- **Chronic Fatigue:** Teams reported declining engagement and meeting burnout.
- **After-Hours Work:** Critical tasks were being pushed to evenings and weekends.
- **Talent Attrition:** Top performers cited "excessive administrative overhead" as a key reason for leaving.

## The Solution: A Three-Phase Overhaul

Acme partnered with **TrySchedule** to implement a comprehensive scheduling framework that combined behavioral change with smart tool adoption.

### Phase 1: The Meeting Audit
We helped Acme analyze their recurring calendar invites. The findings were a wake-up call:
- **60%** of recurring meetings lacked a written agenda.
- **40%** of participants were marked as "optional" but felt obligated to attend.
- Most meetings ran 15 minutes over time due to a lack of structure.

### Phase 2: Policy & "Deep Work" Guardrails
Acme introduced new cultural norms to protect employee time:
- **"No-Meeting Wednesdays":** A full day dedicated to uninterrupted deep work.
- **Speedy Meetings:** Defaulting to 25-minute slots instead of 30, ensuring 5-minute transition breaks.
- **Agenda-First Policy:** No agenda, no meeting.

### Phase 3: TrySchedule Integration
The **TrySchedule Builder** became the central hub for Acme’s organization. Key features used include:
- **Smart Conflict Detection:** Reducing the back-and-forth of finding free slots.
- **Visual Time Blocking:** Helping managers see "Focus Time" vs. "Meeting Time" at a glance.
- **Meeting Cost Awareness:** Showing the aggregate time-value of large group invites.

## The Results: Measureable Impact

After 90 days of using **TrySchedule**, the results exceeded all expectations:

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Weekly Meeting Hours** | 23 hrs | 14 hrs | **-40%** |
| **Focus Time Blocks (2+ hrs)** | 2/week | 6/week | **+200%** |
| **Employee Satisfaction** | 5.2/10 | 7.8/10 | **+50%** |

## Lessons for Your Team

- **Cultural Buy-in is Key:** Tools provide the data, but leadership must model the behavior.
- **Start with "No-Meeting" Zones:** Immediate wins like No-Meeting Wednesdays build momentum.
- **Audit Regularly:** Use scheduling data to identify and kill "zombie meetings" that no longer serve a purpose.

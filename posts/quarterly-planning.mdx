Planning your quarter doesn't have to be a headache. With our new Timeline View, you can visualize your entire quarter at a glance and make strategic decisions with confidence.

## Introducing Timeline View

The Timeline View is our most requested feature, and we're thrilled to finally bring it to you. Unlike the traditional calendar view, the timeline lets you see extended periods—weeks, months, or even quarters—in a single, scrollable interface.

## Key Features

### Milestone Tracking

Mark important deadlines and milestones directly on your timeline. These visual markers help you understand how individual tasks contribute to larger goals.

### Resource Allocation

See at a glance who's working on what and when. Identify potential bottlenecks before they become problems and redistribute workload accordingly.

### Drag-and-Drop Planning

Adjusting timelines is as simple as dragging events to new dates. The system automatically recalculates dependent tasks and alerts you to any conflicts.

## How to Get Started

1. Navigate to your schedule dashboard
2. Click the "View" dropdown in the top-right corner
3. Select "Timeline" from the available options
4. Use the date range selector to zoom in or out

## Pro Tips

- **Color-code by project:** Assign colors to different projects for instant visual recognition
- **Use milestones sparingly:** Too many milestones defeat the purpose—focus on truly critical dates
- **Share with stakeholders:** Generate read-only links for executives who need visibility without edit access

## Conclusion

The Timeline View transforms how you approach quarterly planning. Give it a try today and experience the clarity of seeing your schedule from a new perspective.

We're excited to announce our new tagging system—a feature that brings unprecedented flexibility to how you organize and filter your schedule. Let's explore what's new and how to make the most of it.

## What Are Tags?

Tags are customizable labels you can attach to any event. Unlike categories (which are predefined), tags are completely flexible. Create as many as you need, use any naming convention, and apply multiple tags to a single event.

## Key Features

### Unlimited Tags

Create tags for projects, clients, priority levels, team members, locations—whatever taxonomy makes sense for your workflow.

### Color Coding

Assign colors to tags for instant visual recognition. Your calendar becomes a heat map of your priorities.

### Smart Filtering

The new filter bar lets you include or exclude events based on tag combinations. See only client meetings, or everything except administrative tasks.

### Tag Analytics

Track how you spend your time with our new tag-based analytics. See breakdowns by tag over any time period.

## How to Use Tags

### Creating Tags

1. Click the tag icon in the event editor
2. Type a new tag name or select existing ones
3. Optionally assign a color
4. Click "Add"

### Filtering by Tags

1. Click the filter icon in your calendar toolbar
2. Select tags to include (blue) or exclude (red)
3. Your view updates in real-time

### Managing Tags

Visit **Settings > Tags** to rename, merge, or delete tags. Changes apply retroactively to all tagged events.

## Pro Tips

- **Create a tag hierarchy:** Use prefixes like "Client: Acme" and "Client: Beta Corp" for easy grouping
- **Tag templates:** Create event templates with pre-applied tags for faster event creation
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** Press "T" while an event is selected to quickly add tags

## Migration from Labels

If you were using our old Labels feature, your labels have been automatically converted to tags. The transition is seamless—no action required on your part.

## Feedback Welcome

Tags are just the beginning. We're planning additional organization features based on your feedback. Share your ideas in our community forum!

We are excited to announce the launch of the **TrySchedule Tagging System**—a feature that brings unprecedented flexibility to how you organize, filter, and analyze your schedule.

Let's explore what is new and how you can leverage tags to master your time management.

## What Are TrySchedule Tags?

Tags are customizable, high-visibility labels you can attach to any event. Unlike traditional predefined categories, tags offer complete flexibility:
- **Create as many as you need** for different taxonomies.
- **Apply multiple tags** to a single event for cross-functional tracking.
- **Use any naming convention** that fits your unique workflow.

## Key Features for Visual Organization

### Unlimited Tag Creation
Create tags for specific projects, high-priority clients, team members, or physical locations. Your taxonomy can be as broad or as granular as your work requires.

### Dynamic Color Coding
Assign distinct colors to your tags for instant visual recognition. Your calendar essentially becomes a "heat map" of your weekly priorities.

### Advanced Smart Filtering
The new filter bar allows you to include or exclude events based on complex tag combinations. See only your "Deep Work" sessions or filter out all "Administrative" tasks with one click.

### Tag-Based Analytics
Track exactly how you spend your time with our new analytics dashboard. See a professional breakdown of hours spent per tag over any selected time period.

## How to Implement Tags in Your Workflow

### Creating and Applying Tags
- Open any event in the editor and click the **Tag Icon**.
- Type a new tag name or select from your existing library.
- Assign a custom color for better visual tracking.
- Click **"Add"** to apply the tag instantly.

### Filtering Your View
- Click the **Filter Icon** in your main calendar toolbar.
- Select tags to include (highlighted in blue) or exclude (highlighted in red).
- Your schedule view will update in real-time to show relevant events.

### Global Tag Management
Visit **Settings > Tags** to rename, merge, or delete tags across your entire account. All changes apply retroactively, ensuring your historical data stays clean and organized.

## Pro Tips for Power Users

- **Implement a Hierarchy:** Use prefixes like "Client: Alpha" or "Meeting: External" to keep your tag list organized.
- **Leverage Tag Templates:** Create event templates with pre-applied tags to accelerate your scheduling speed.

## Seamless Migration from Labels

If you were using our legacy Labels feature, all your data has been automatically migrated to the new tagging system.  This transition is completely seamless, requiring no manual action on your part. 

## We Value Your Feedback

The new tagging system is just the beginning of our organizational roadmap.  We are continuously refining these features based on your input. Share your ideas and use cases in our community forum!
